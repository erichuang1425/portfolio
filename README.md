# Art Portfolio

This repository contains a simple art portfolio website. It includes the following sections:

- Personal information/About Me
- Portfolio (knits, prints, weave, garment, embroidery)
- CV
- Contact Me form

## Adding Images

Place any artwork images inside the `images` directory. Two placeholder files are referenced for the "Heritage Threads" garments:

- `images/heritage1.jpg`
- `images/heritage2.jpg`

Add your actual image files with those names and they will appear automatically in the Garment section.

## Running Locally

No special build steps are required. Simply open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
