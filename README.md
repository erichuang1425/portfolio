# Art Portfolio

This repository contains a simple art portfolio website. It now uses a fixed
left sidebar for navigation. The menu links are:

- **Gallery** â€“ with subpages for weave, print, embroidery, knit and garment
- **CV**
- **About Me** (index.html)
- **Contact**

## Adding Images

Place any artwork images inside the `images` directory. Two placeholder files are referenced for the "Heritage Threads" garments:

- `images/heritage1.jpg`
- `images/heritage2.jpg`

Add your actual image files with those names and they will appear automatically in the Garment section.

## Running Locally

No special build steps are required. Simply open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
